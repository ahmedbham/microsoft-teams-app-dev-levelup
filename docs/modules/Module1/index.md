## Module 1 - Tab Apps

- Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams.
- They're simple HTML `<iframe/>` tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest and can be added as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user
- You can include custom tabs with your app to embed your own web content in Teams or add Teams-specific functionality to your web content.
